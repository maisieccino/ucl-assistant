# UCL Assistant - App

App source code for UCL Assistant.

## Getting up and running

You'll need the Expo XDE client or the Expo command line client. Get them from
[here](https://expo.io/tools). You'll also need Yarn or NPM installed.

Copy `app.example.json` to `app.json` and add your own Google Maps API key and
either modify or delete the Sentry sourcemap hook.

The Google Maps API key is optional but without it you won't be able to use Maps
on Android. You'll want to create an API key on the
[Google APIs console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/) and then give
the key access to the Google Maps Android API.

Then you can start the app with `exp start` or by loading it in XDE.

## Which API server?

production mode: uses api.assistant.mbell.me

development mode: uses ucl-assistant.herokuapp.com

## Saving user data

The app uses [redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) to save the
app state to the device storage. In the future, for extra security, the `user`
reducer will be saved using the `Expo.SecureStore` API.
